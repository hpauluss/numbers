# numbers

Some demonstration scripts for number systems.

The bash script [crea-palindrome-year.sh](crea-palindrome-year.sh) creates an ImageMagick picture of *palindromic years* with markup of prime numbers.

By default, the script runs for the year range 10-2000. If you want to use another range, modify the variables `FIRST` and `LAST` at the beginning of the script.

The script needs access to the perl script [check_prime.pl](check_prime.pl) to analyse whether a year (or any number) is a prime or not.

## TODO:

  - Add year range as input variables.
